/**
 * abstract class
 * 1. abstract class have constructor and destructor, but interface do not have it.
 * 2. abstract class can have different accessing control in method, like protected, but all the method in interface need to be public.
 * 3. a class can inherit only one abstract class, but a class can inherited many interfaces.
 * 4. abstract class is good at default implement, but interface is not good at that, it is nightmare for interface.
 * 5. abstract class can be initialized, but interface can not.
 * 6. abstract class is used for avoiding independence, but interface is used for controlling signatures.
 * 7. abstract class must write keyword "abstract" for method, but interface do not need it.
 * 8. abstract class is faster than interface.
 * 9. abstract class only can extend only one class, but interface can implement many interfaces.
 * 10 variable in abstract class can have different type, but the variable in interface only can have public static final.
